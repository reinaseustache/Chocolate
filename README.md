# Chocolate_App

For my Modern Middle East class, we had a choice of how to present our projects, so I decided to create an Android App on my chosen topic - Chocolate.  It discusses chocolate in different regions such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE and associated market trends since chocolate is a popular commodity in the Middle East.
